# TenseTime
A simple script for reading movement words like speed and tension (Mastery of Movement, by Rudolf Laban) and applying them for primitives in Maya.

The script will allow the creation of primitives, then read an xml file with their speed and tension levels for frame intervals
After this experiments, more motion factors can be experimented with
The reference book I'm using is Rudolf Laban's Mastery of Movement.
