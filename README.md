# TenseTime
A simple script for reading movement values like speed and tension (Mastery of Movement, by Rudolf Laban) and applying them for primitives in Maya.

The script will allow the creation of primitives, then read an xml file with their speed and tension levels for a series of phrases.
Speed is turned into timing, while tension is turned into spacing for the object in the scene.
The reference book I'm using is Rudolf Laban's Mastery of Movement.
